'''
In an imaginary country called Lisarb, 
all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians 
and the taxes are used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation. 
The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. 
Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.

    0,00 - 2.000,00         Whithou Taxes
2.000,01 - 3.000,00              8%
3.000,01 - 4.500,00             18%
More than 4.500,00              28%


Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00, 
because the salary from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. In the follow example, 
the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00, resulting in R$ 80.36 at all. 
The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

Input
The input contains only a float-point number, with 2 digits after the decimal point.

Output
Print the message "R$" followed by a blank space and the total tax to be payed, 
with two digits after the decimal point. If the value is up to 2000, print the message "Isento".
