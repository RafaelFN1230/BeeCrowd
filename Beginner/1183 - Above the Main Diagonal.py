'''
Read an uppercase character that indicates an operation that will be performed in an array M[12][12]. 
Then, calculate and print the sum or average considering only that numbers that are above the main diagonal 
of the array, like shown in the following figure (green area).




Input
The first line of the input contains a single uppercase character O ('S' or 'M'), 
indicating the operation Sum or Average (MÃ©dia in portuguese) to be performed with the elements of the array.
